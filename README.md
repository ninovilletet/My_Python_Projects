# My_Python_Projects

Hi there ! My name is Nino and I'm a little programer.  
Here you can find some of the programs I made on my own and for now I only create [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs.  
I know that they're not perfect so you might encounter a few errors.  

## Installation   

1. Open a terminal   

2. Type these commands :   

`git clone https://github.com/ninovilletet/My_Python_Projects.git`    

`cd My_Python_Projects`    


For Linux / Termux / macOS :  

`python3 main.py`    

For Windows :  

`python main.py`  


3. And then, you can just follow the instructions within the programs.  

I hope you'll like them and if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ninovilletet/My_Python_Projects/issues)
