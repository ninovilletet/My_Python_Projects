# My_Python_Projects

Hi there ! My name is Nino and I'm a little programer.  
Here you can find some of the programs I made on my own and for now I only create Python programs.  
I know that they're not perfect so you might encounter a few errors.  

Open a terminal and type these commands :   

`git clone https://github.com/ninovilletet/My_Python_Projects.git`    

`cd My_Python_Projects`    


For macOS / Linux :  

`python3 (the_name_of_the_program).py`    


For Windows :  

`python "name_of_the_program.py"`  


I hope you'll like them and if there is a problem, feel free to send me a feedback.
